        <h1>Rooted in the Sierra Nevada</h1>
        <p>Bridging the gap between traditional field forestry and modern data science.</p>
    </hgroup>
    <p>
        Based in Gold Run, California, Steinley Forestry & GIS Consulting is a husband-and-wife team dedicated
        to sustainable forest management.
        We believe that the best decisions are made when boots-on-the-ground observation is paired with
        high-precision geospatial analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
        With advanced degrees in forestry and years of experience navigating the complex regulatory environment
        of California,
        we help landowners, agencies, and conservation groups manage their land effectively.
