<!-- 3. THE PROBLEM SECTION -->
<section id="problem">
    <h2 style="color: #d81b60;">The Insurance Reality</h2>
    <div class="grid">
        <div>
            <p><strong>Insurers aren't waiting.</strong> Carriers are manually dropping homes across Placer and
                Nevada counties based on outdated satellite imagery.</p>
            <p>New California regulations (Zone 0) require a 5-foot ember-resistant zone, but insurance
                underwriters often demand even more defensible space.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>To keep your policy, you don't just need a gardener—you need <strong>professional proof of
                    compliance</strong>. We provide the documentation underwriters require to rescind a
                non-renewal notice.</p>

            <p>Most tree services are great at running chainsaws, but they can't write the technical risk
                reports insurance companies demand.</p>
            <p><strong>We are TRAQ (Tree Risk Assessment Qualification) credentialed.</strong> This means our
                assessments follow an international standard recognised by liability insurers and legal
                entities.</p>
